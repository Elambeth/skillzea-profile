# Skillzea Profile Page

## Overview
This project is a React-based implementation of a profile page for Skillzea, a platform connecting customers with local skilled workers. The profile page showcases a skiller's information, skills, and testimonials in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Display of skiller's basic information (name, location, availability)
- Custom avatar generation using initials
- Skills display with tag-like design
- Overall star rating
- Testimonials section with individual ratings
- "Call this skiller" functionality with a popup display of contact information

## Recent Updates
1. **Avatar Implementation**: 
   - Integrated the `avvvatars-react` library to generate custom avatars based on the skiller's initials.
   - This provides skillers with a custom profile photo that is unique to them while still remaining anonymous and not needing to upload any person photos.

2. **Star rating system**
    - This allows for a users to give feedback to skillers which is then displayed on the skillers profile giving future members more information to improve decision making. 
    - Skillers with higher ratings could also appear higher on your search order

3. **Testimonials**
    - In addition to a star rating, users also can provide a testimonial for a skiller, this is then displayed on the skillers profile
    - Allows users to read custom feedback written by another person to improve decision making
